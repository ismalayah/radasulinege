In the early days of his career, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Morgan Freeman</a></strong> struggled with the idea of being stuck as a children’s performer for the rest of his life. While the Shawshank Redemption actor has certainly found his stride, it was a long, winding road he walked to establish himself as a serious actor.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=788 data-current-count=788 data-injectable=true>Long before he was using his velvety tones to narrate documentaries or deliver emotionally charged monologues, Freeman was a founding cast member of a little-known 1970s children’s program called The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Electric Company</a>. The show was funded by PBS and filmed in the same studio that housed the early education television series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sesame Street</a>. Despite the overlap, the two series were entirely separate from one another, and Freeman claims there was no sense of competition between the programs. The Electric Company used only human actors and taught kids grammar, comprehension, and reading skills, like much of PBS’ children’s’ programming. But The Electric Company stood apart from the competition by teaching through sketch comedy-like skits for kids between the ages of 5 and 10.</p><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true>Geared at an older crowd than Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood, The Electric Company worked more tongue-in-cheek-style gags into its routines, leaving space for parents to enjoy the many skits the series offered. While the entire cast embodied the comedic and groovy vibes, there was something incredibly inviting about the lanky Freeman, and his silky dulcet tones and laid-back demeanor.</p><p data-characters=775 data-current-count=775 data-injectable=true>As a core member of the cast, Freeman had a number of roles: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vincent the Vegetable Vampire</a>, a debonair vegetarian vampire who taught viewers the importance of eating their vegetables all while emphasizing V words;&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DJ Mel Mounds</a>! a rhyming, smooth-talking DJ who ran a radio station that parodied popular songs; and his most popular character, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Easy Reader</a>, a free-spirited hippie who enjoyed reading to an extreme degree, just to name a few. Each of his roles taught kids specific sounds and word recognition while embodying the groovy style of the ‘70s. While fans remember his tenure on the show fondly, the glory was short-lived for Freeman, who admits in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this interview with Rich Eisen </a>that his stint on the show was less than ideal, confessing “[it] terrified me.”</p><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>It wasn’t the kids or his vampire impression that filled Freeman with dread, rather it was the idea that he could get stuck like so many other actors in children’s programming. Once he was pegged as Easy Reader, there was a chance he could never escape the profile that viewers saw him in daily. &nbsp;Freeman was already in his 30s when he landed the gig, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to producer</a> Joan Ganz Cooney, “it was a very unhappy period in his life.”</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=182 data-injectable=false>Morgan continues, “You get identified with that and I really was afraid of becoming… Not typecast. Cast! Like being there. If that show had kept going, I might still be there.”</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=true>Freeman’s fear wasn’t unfounded. Though The Electric Company only ran from 1971 to 1977, its sister series, Sesame Street, is still going strong. One of its original cast members and a core recurring character, Big Bird, only recently changed hands, with the puppet being worked by the same man, Caroll Spinney, for nearly 50 years.</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>Freeman has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shared anecdotes</a> about the rigors of having a fan base so young. From freezing parade appearances to fans discarding autographs minutes after obtaining them, being a performer for children was a mostly thankless job. But what can you expect when your audience demographic is between 4 and 10?</p><p data-characters=718 data-current-count=1022 data-injectable=true>Despite his prominent role in the series, it would be almost ten years before Freeman would get his big Hollywood break. He finally hit the big time in 1989, with his roles in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Glory</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Driving Miss Daisy</a>. It may have taken the Unforgiven actor nearly a decade to shake the memory of Easy Rider and his time on The Electric Company, but the same dulcet tones that captured the attention of children for more than five years have served him well. Morgan Freeman may have little love for his first television appearances, but the clear diction he demonstrated while teaching thousands of kids across the world how to read certainly prepared him for the plethora of documentaries he has since loaned his velvety voice to.</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=251 data-injectable=false>With most of his original fans well into their 40s at this point, there is little doubt that some of Freeman’s success comes from the legion of fans he gained in his early appearances as Easy Reader, DJ Mel Mounds, and Vincent the Vegetable Vampire.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2br7EmqOlsV2srrR5wJ%2BpmqGUYrqwvsaapWaeopqyrq3NZq6aq12psrO%2ByJ%2BgnpxdrLWquMRmrqiqm567qHnOp2StoJVisq2xwq2poptdmLyuvMCnsGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fi-really-was-afraid-morgan-freeman-was-terrified-while-working-on-the-electric-company.html&text=I%20really%20was%20afraid%3a%20Morgan%20Freeman%20was%20terrified%20while%20working%20on%20The%20Electric%20Compa&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fi-really-was-afraid-morgan-freeman-was-terrified-while-working-on-the-electric-company.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fi-really-was-afraid-morgan-freeman-was-terrified-while-working-on-the-electric-company.html&title=I%20really%20was%20afraid%3a%20Morgan%20Freeman%20was%20terrified%20while%20working%20on%20The%20Electric%20Compa" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fi-really-was-afraid-morgan-freeman-was-terrified-while-working-on-the-electric-company.html&title=I%20really%20was%20afraid%3a%20Morgan%20Freeman%20was%20terrified%20while%20working%20on%20The%20Electric%20Compa" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fi-really-was-afraid-morgan-freeman-was-terrified-while-working-on-the-electric-company.html&title=I%20really%20was%20afraid%3a%20Morgan%20Freeman%20was%20terrified%20while%20working%20on%20The%20Electric%20Compa" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fi-really-was-afraid-morgan-freeman-was-terrified-while-working-on-the-electric-company.html&description=I%20really%20was%20afraid%3a%20Morgan%20Freeman%20was%20terrified%20while%20working%20on%20The%20Electric%20Compa" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jose-bautistas-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jos Bautistas net worth, biography, fact, career, awards and life story">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./william-shatner-pays-tribute-late-star-trek-costar-leonard-nimoy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="William Shatner Pays Tribute To Late Star Trek Co-Star Leonard Nimoy On Anniversary Of His Death">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
