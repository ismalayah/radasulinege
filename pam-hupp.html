Currently, she is incarcerated.&nbsp;</p><p>Her birthday is October 10, and she was born in 1958. Pamela Marie Neumann is the complete form of her given name.</p><p>Her age as of this moment is 63 years. Her zodiac sign is Libra. Riverview Gardens High School is the institution where she received her diploma after completing her schooling there.&nbsp;</p><p>The University of Texas at Austin College is where she receives her education.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Family</strong></h2><p>Her mother and father died from injuries sustained when they fell through the third-floor balcony railing. Her father passed away on June 2, 2000.</p><p>The names of Pam’s parents are now being discussed: Victor Joseph Neumann Jr. (Pam’s father) and Shirley Neumann (mother).</p><p>She is the sister of two brothers, whose names are Michael Neumann and Dan Neumann, respectively, and whose wives’ names are Alexis and Juliann, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Sheri Wasserman is the only sister, and her name is also Sheri.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Pam Hupp Children and husband</strong></h2><p>Pam has tied the knot with Mark Hupp. He is her second marriage, and information about her first husband is unavailable on any social networking sites.&nbsp;</p><p>Her current husband works in the construction industry. In 1989, Pam and Mark uprooted their family and relocated from Naples, Florida, to O’Fallon, Missouri. There, they have since established themselves.</p><p>This couple is parents to two children: a daughter by the name of Sarah and a son by the name of Travis Hupp, who has a different father.&nbsp;</p><p>They attend Timberland High School and Ranken Technical College to study Information Technology (IT).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Professional Life</strong></h2><p>Pam is a dangerous person who has serious mental and physical limitations due to her life experiences.&nbsp;</p><p>She killed Kippenberger for personal protection after he stalked her into her home while carrying a knife, which was not acknowledged by law enforcement.&nbsp;</p><p>Before she could go to discuss the crime and before it could file accusations of first-degree murder against her.</p><p>She was a crucial witness in the case that led to the conviction of Russ Faria in 2013 for the stabbing death of his wife, Besty Faria, in 2011. Besty Faria was found dead in her house in Troy, Missouri, in 2011.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Crime story of Pam Hupp</strong></h2><p>Pam Hupp murdered Betsy Faria, and she has been charged with first-degree murder and armed criminal action, which occurred in December 2011.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Pam Hupp murdered her friend</strong></h3><p>Betsy Faria was found stabbed to death in her house in Troy, Missouri, shortly after Christmas in 2011. She was the last person to see her alive before she killed her.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the court documents that Dateline obtained this week, Pam Hupp followed her friend’s every move on Tuesday, December 27, 2011, waiting until she was weak and lethargic from chemotherapy that day before giving her a ride home.</p><p>Pam knew that Betsy’s husband, Russ, would not be there. Russ, Betsy’s husband, came home from the monthly game night he attended with his friends and found his wife’s body in the bathroom.</p><p>Betsy was stabbed multiple times, and according to the court documents, Hupp is accused of dipping Betsy’s socks in her blood and spreading it around the house to make it appear as though her husband was the one who killed her in a domestic dispute. Multiple stab wounds killed Betsy.</p><p>The court record continues to detail a “compelling circumstantial murder case, one that is very difficult to reject,” as described by Lincoln County Prosecutor Mike Wood.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this, he continued, the facts of the case were disregarded, and he announced that there would be a fresh inquiry into “possible prosecutorial and police wrongdoing in the Betsy Faria case.”</p><p>Betsy, diagnosed with terminal cancer four days before the murder, had designated her close friend Pam as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy worth $150,000 in place of her deceased husband.&nbsp;</p><p>Betsy’s other friends and relatives, including Russ, stated that they were unaware of the transformation that had taken place.</p><p>In 2012, Russ was arrested and charged with Betsy’s murder following an inquiry in which Hupp allegedly pointed the finger at Russ as the person responsible for Betsy’s death.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, Hupp testified against him during his trial in November 2013, which took place in 2013. A jury reached a guilty verdict, and he was sentenced to prison for his crime.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How do things reverse on her?</strong></h3><p>In November 2015, during Faria’s retrial in front of a different judge, his defense attorney, Joel Schwartz, pointed the finger at Hupp as the individual who had both the motive and the chance to kill Betsy.&nbsp;</p><p>Hupp was not called to testify by either of the opposing parties.</p><p>Faria did not receive a conviction this time around. The prosecutor for Lincoln County at the time, who was in charge of the prosecution’s case against Russ during both trials, continued to insist that Russ was the person responsible for Betsy’s death.</p><p>The following year, in August of 2016, Hupp shot and killed a man she claimed had confronted her in the driveway of her home in O’Fallon, Missouri, demanding “Russ’s money” and threatening to murder her.&nbsp;</p><p>Hupp fired and killed the man. Investigators concluded that the man in question, Louis Gumpenberger, was not an intruder but rather a collaborator in Hupp’s plan to falsely accuse Russ Faria of being a violent individual and frame him for the crime.</p><p>Gumpenberger was a victim of a brain injury. Investigators said that Hupp, under the guise of a Dateline producer, approached Gumpenberger when he suffered a brain injury.&nbsp;</p><p>Investigators are under the impression that Hupp enticed Gumpenberger into her car with a false promise of financial compensation to play the role of a 911 caller for an upcoming program, which Dateline would never undertake.</p><p>Hupp was arrested and charged with Gumpenberger’s murder one week after the incident.&nbsp;</p><p>In the summer of 2019, Hupp appeared in a courtroom in St. Charles County, Missouri, and entered an Alford plea in the case, which allowed her to avoid a trial that may have resulted in the death penalty.</p><p>Hupp admitted that the prosecution had enough evidence to accuse her of the murder of Gumpenberger, but she maintained that she was innocent of the crime. She was given a sentence of life imprisonment for her crime.</p><p>This case was the impetus for newly-elected Lincoln County Prosecuting Attorney Mike Wood to revive the murder investigation into Betsy Faria, which ultimately resulted in the charges being brought today.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Where are Pam Hupp’s daughters and sons?</strong></h2><p>According to information provided by Distractify, Pam Hupp is the mother of two children in real life: a son named Travis and a daughter named Sarah.&nbsp;</p><p>There is currently no information available regarding Sarah and Travis’s whereabouts.</p><p>&nbsp;It’s possible they wished to avoid the public’s spotlight and were embarrassed by their mother’s choices throughout her life.</p><p>Sarah does not actively participate in any social media; the media will not have access to sufficient details about her.&nbsp;</p><p>The only evidence we have is that Sarah was Hupp’s firstborn child, born from her first marriage; Travis, on the other hand, is Hupp’s second born child, born from her second marriage.</p><p>Before Hupp and his family moved to Missouri, Travis was taken in and reared by Hupp’s mother and father in their home in Florida.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Why Did Pam Hupp Kill Betsy Faria?</strong></h3><p>In July of 2021, an authorized skill by the name of Wood filed charges against Pam Hupp for the murder of Betsy Faria.&nbsp;</p><p>He accused Pam of setting up Betsy’s husband, Russ Faria, as the murderer and framing him. What was it that made Pam decide to take Betsy’s life?</p><p>Pam, a woman with two children, has been accused of the deaths of Betsy Faria, a very intriguing friend of Pam’s, and Louis Gumpenberger.</p><p>In 2005, Louis had severe mental and physical problems as a direct result of a fatal car accident that occurred the previous year. He was a citizen of Union, Missouri.</p><p>According to the documentation, Betsy was scheduled to have chemotherapy on the day she was murdered in 2011. In addition, in 2010, she determined that she had breast cancer.</p><p>Pam on the internet was the one who murdered Louis Gumpenberger on August 16, 2016.</p><p>Gumpenberger was fatally wounded after Hupp fired five shots at him inside her O’Fallon home, located at 1260 Little Brave Drive. She is serving a sentence of life in prison.</p><p>As a result of the investigation into Betsy Faria, Wood brought charges against Pam, charging her with the first-degree murder of Betsy Faria and the armed jail movement.&nbsp;</p><p>She received around 55 stab wounds and broke both wrists down to the bone.</p><p>She had what seemed to be a serrated kitchen knife stuck in her neck. The other knife was discovered on the couch where she had been lying unconscious when it was discovered.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Why did Pam Hupp cut her neck?</strong></h2><p>After she sliced Betsy Faria’s throat absurdly in 2011, the woman was charged with first-degree murder.&nbsp;</p><p>In the wake of someone being confined, she requested to go to the restroom, and once she was inside, she used a ballpoint pen to cut her wrists and neck as part of an obvious attempt at self-destruction.</p><p>Pam Hupp is notoriously known as an American murderer who is currently serving a daily sentence at the “Chillicothe Correctional Center” in the state of Missouri for the murder of Louis Gumpenberger in her O’Fallon residence in the year 2016.</p><p>Hupp’s assertion that it was justified for her to shoot Gumpenberger (who had mental and physical problems) after he pursued her into her home with a blade was not entirely accepted by legal experts.</p><p>In 2019, the tale of Hupp was included as the subject of a well-known web recording of true misbehavior. The fact that The Thing about Pam is based on a true event piqued many viewers’ interest, and they are eager to learn more about Pam.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Where is Pam Hupp Right Now?</strong></h2><p>Pam is serving her sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center, life in jail. She will spend the rest of her life in prison without the possibility of ever being released on parole.</p><p>Hupp framed Russ Faria, Betsy Faria’s spouse, before he passed away. She shifted the focus of the investigation away from herself and onto Russ, claiming that Russ had murdered Betsy to collect the money from Betsy’s insurance policy.</p><p>In 2016, when Pam admitted to her crime of killing Louis, legal expert Mike Wood announced that he might be restarting the Betsy Faria homicide case. It came after Pam stated that she had killed Louis. He thought the murders might all be related to one another somehow.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Movie of Pam Hupp</strong></h2><p>The podcasts by Dateline with the same name that examined the murder of Betsy Faria in 2011 served as the inspiration for the show “The Thing About Pam.”&nbsp;</p><p>After the death of Faria, her husband, Russ Faria, was arrested and charged with murder in 2013. He was sentenced to nearly two years until his defense attorney successfully petitioned for a retrial.&nbsp;</p><p>Russ was finally cleared of all charges in 2015 with the discovery of fresh evidence and more focus on Faria’s friend Pam Hupp.</p><p>Pam hupp movie “The Thing About Pam.” was released on March 8 2022. I get a hug for people’s love and appreciation as a project and film.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The net worth of Pam Hupp</strong></h2><p>The amount of money that Pamp Hupp makes is not revealed anywhere. Because she is serving a life term in jail for her crimes, you are all aware that she does not have a source of income.&nbsp;</p><p>However, in the past, she has worked for a few different businesses.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidnqm%2FprzRnqWeraKitq%2Bw2WeaqKVfpa6ueceup6ln</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpam-hupp.html&text=The%20Untold%20Truth%20About%20Betsy%20Faria%27s%20Murder&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpam-hupp.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpam-hupp.html&title=The%20Untold%20Truth%20About%20Betsy%20Faria%27s%20Murder" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpam-hupp.html&title=The%20Untold%20Truth%20About%20Betsy%20Faria%27s%20Murder" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpam-hupp.html&title=The%20Untold%20Truth%20About%20Betsy%20Faria%27s%20Murder" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpam-hupp.html&description=The%20Untold%20Truth%20About%20Betsy%20Faria%27s%20Murder" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./true-romance-1993.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="True Romance movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1993)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./aussie-actress-adelaide-kane-and-dutch-girlfriend-marthe-woertman-passionately-kiss.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aussie actress Adelaide Kane and Dutch girlfriend Marthe Woertman passionately kiss">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
