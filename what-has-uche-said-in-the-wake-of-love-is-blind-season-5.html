The Houston-based lawyer and entrepreneur put out good energy at first, as he chatted his way <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">through a series of dates</a>, but when things got serious, fans got salty. A prickly conversation between Uche and his main match of the season, Aaliyah Cosby, lost Uche any fans he may have had, after he belittled the ICU nurse over a two-years past cheating incident. Disapproving of cheating is all well and good, but Uche’s reaction didn’t earn him many fans — particularly once his own baggage was laid bare.</p><p data-characters=656 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>On top of his clear overreaction to Aaliyah’s honesty, Uche was sitting on a major red flag (or 12) of his own. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">He knew one of the other contestants</a> — and a close bond of Aaliyah’s — before they entered the pods. He and Lydia (who also so happens to be half of the only successful season 5 couple) dated before they entered the experiment, and their previous knowledge of one another put the bounds of the experiment at risk. They were allowed to stay on, following assurances that they wouldn’t say anything until they made a connection, but Uche’s major reaction to Aaliyah’s honesty felt sour in the wake of this news.</p><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>Then there’s all the other drama. Uche’s reaction upon speaking to Aaliyah on the phone? Red flag. His behavior, and the lack of accountability, when they met in person? Massive red flag. The man appeared, at least through those Love is Blind cuts, to be the season’s standout villain, but his response to its reunion episode — which he chose not to attend — throws that villainy into question. Is Uche really as bad as he comes across on screen, or are his bad qualities a result of careful editing?</p><h2 id=h-what-did-uche-say-about-love-is-blind-on-instagram data-injectable=false>What did Uche say about Love is Blind on Instagram?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Uche Okoroha (@imabovethelaw)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=613 data-current-count=913 data-injectable=true>Getting a “bad” edit has long weighed Love is Blind contestants down, and it seems Uche may be the most recent victim of the practice — at least, according to him. We don’t have many other perspectives on the matter just yet, but it does seem worth noting that, in the reunion, few people stepped up to defend Uche. Aaliyah, who spoke with — and even tried dating — Uche following the show’s conclusion, stated that she believes she was never his type. She also clarified that, while they were dating, Uche’s tone was “still so very mean and kind of condescending.”</p><p data-characters=475 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>Because Uche failed to attend the reunion, he had no opportunity to respond to Aaliya’s version of events, or to the series of largely negative season 5 footage that was shown of him. Instead, he took to Instagram in the hours after the episode aired to push back on the overarching narrative, and answer a few fan questions about his time on the show.

To be fair, he came with plenty of receipts, but none of them quite explained away the behavior his cast mates recall Uche exhibiting. Uche also faced accusations of treating the Black women on the show particularly poorly, a claim he worked to explain away.</p><p data-characters=548 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>In response to questions about his attraction to Aaliyah, Uche explained that he does think “Aaliyah is beautiful,” and that “I love Black women, find Black women attractive and date Black women.” He seemingly tossed some shade Aaliyah’s way by also noting that its easier to “find an excuse as to why your relationship didn’t work out than to take accountability.” At several points throughout his story, he redirected people to an hour-long interview he engaged in with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Miss Understood podcast</a>.</p><p data-characters=594 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>He also addressed the gap people noted between “pod Uche” and “BBQ Uche.” In the pods, Uche largely came across as intelligent, straightforward, and reasonably pleasant, but at the BBQ he was aggressive, confrontational, and sometimes straight-up mean. In the reuinion, Aaliya noted that the Uche she dated, post-Love is Blind, was far more similar to BBQ Uche than pod Uche. According to the man himself, however, he prefers “actual Uche,” who you can apparently “only find in person, not in an artificial environment filmed for entertainment purposes.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Uche Okoroha (@imabovethelaw)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>Its fair to note that the format of Love is Blind is carefully constructed to produce certain results, but claims from other cast members — most notably Aaliyah — indicate that this may be yet another attempt, on Uche’s part, to paint himself as less of a villain.</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=false>The Instagram Q&A isn’t doing much to curry favor for Uche, but perhaps the podcast will be more effective. On the episode, which aired just ahead of the reunion, Uche addressed several of the standout topics from Love is Blind season 5, but the comment section shows just how unimpressed viewers are. Most people still see him as the official villain of season 5, and no amount of backtracking is going to change their minds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZp%2Baq12qsKmxjKyYopxdnrtuwMeeZLCZm5p6sLKMpaavnV2ewG6uy6KlnWWjmq60u81mbGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-has-uche-said-in-the-wake-of-love-is-blind-season-5.html&text=What%20has%20Uche%20said%20in%20the%20wake%20of%20Love%20is%20Blind%20season%205%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-has-uche-said-in-the-wake-of-love-is-blind-season-5.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-has-uche-said-in-the-wake-of-love-is-blind-season-5.html&title=What%20has%20Uche%20said%20in%20the%20wake%20of%20Love%20is%20Blind%20season%205%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-has-uche-said-in-the-wake-of-love-is-blind-season-5.html&title=What%20has%20Uche%20said%20in%20the%20wake%20of%20Love%20is%20Blind%20season%205%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-has-uche-said-in-the-wake-of-love-is-blind-season-5.html&title=What%20has%20Uche%20said%20in%20the%20wake%20of%20Love%20is%20Blind%20season%205%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-has-uche-said-in-the-wake-of-love-is-blind-season-5.html&description=What%20has%20Uche%20said%20in%20the%20wake%20of%20Love%20is%20Blind%20season%205%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./doc-1971.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Doc movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1971)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./itzy-world-tour-2024-tickets-prices-and-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="ITZY World Tour 2024 tickets, prices and more">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
