Here’s how Powell’s student status at University of Mount Union, and whether or not she was in a sorority at the school, affected the case.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=#>NBC News</a>, Powell, then 19-years-old, struck her mother in the head and then proceeded to stab her 30 times in the neck. Powell’s mother, Brenda Powell, was on the phone with the University of Mount Union (UMU), where Sydney had been enrolled, when the incident happened. Brenda, who was 50 when she died, was pronounced dead at an Akron, Ohio hospital, the <a href=#>Akron Beacon Journal</a> reported.</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>Reportedly, Sydney was a good student who played soccer in high school, but once in college, she began to show signs of mental health challenges. Her parents, however, had no idea how bad things had become for their daughter until it was too late. Only a short time before Brenda died, in fact, Sydney showed up home from college, unannounced.</p><h2 id=h-sydney-powell-was-asked-to-leave-umu data-injectable=false>Sydney Powell was asked to leave UMU</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>Reportedly, when Sydney Powell arrived at home from school, she had been dismissed from the University of Mount Union, in Ohio, where she had been awarded a partial scholarship, per the <a href=#>Akron Beacon Journal</a>. Once enrolled, her mental health caused her grades to decline, and as a result, she was put on academic probation and eventually asked to leave. Sydney, however, didn’t tell her parents about her standing at the school, even after she returned home.</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>But more than academic anxiety contributed to Sydney attacking and killing her mother. While still at UMU, she reportedly experienced periods where she couldn’t remember what had happened, and slept excessive amounts throughout the day, among other symptoms. All combined, these issues likely affected Sydney’s performance at the university, and once back at home, Sydney reportedly continued to hear voices.</p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>Concussions suffered through soccer were a possible explanation of Sydney’s mental state, but prior to her trial, several experts concluded when she killed her mother, she likely experienced a psychotic break.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>No UMU, no sorority</strong>?</h2><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=670 data-injectable=true>Details are scarce as to whether or not Sydney Powell belonged to a sorority while at the University of Mount Union, and if so, which one, but according to <a href=#>True Crime Lounge</a>, her expulsion from UMU meant she would not be able to go forward with her plans to join one. This, as well as the dismissal from the school, poor grades, and mental health challenges, all likely worsened Sydney’s distress in the time leading up to her mother’s death.</p><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>As mentioned, several experts declared Sydney not guilty by reason of insanity, matching Sydney’s plea, but one evaluation reportedly found her sane when her mother was killed, and the trial proceeded. In addition to murder, Sydney was also found guilty of assault and tampering with evidence, per <a href=#>NBC News</a>.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=676 data-injectable=false>Prior to his daughter’s trial, and having just lost his wife under unimaginable circumstances, Sydney’s father, Steve Powell, asked for his daughter not to be tried for his wife’s death, and the not guilty by reason of insanity plea to be recognized. “I’m trying to keep my family together,” Steve said (via <a href=#>Akron Beacon Journal</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9aaqmarqZm7psWMqaawnZyheqq6jJpkrKeipL%2BqwNhmmK1lpJ2ybsHNoq2eqqOewbp5zp9kpqelo8Fuwc2ipqdn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwas-sydney-powell-in-a-sorority-at-the-university-of-mount-union.html&text=Was%20Sydney%20Powell%20in%20a%20sorority%20at%20the%20University%20of%20Mount%20Union%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwas-sydney-powell-in-a-sorority-at-the-university-of-mount-union.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwas-sydney-powell-in-a-sorority-at-the-university-of-mount-union.html&title=Was%20Sydney%20Powell%20in%20a%20sorority%20at%20the%20University%20of%20Mount%20Union%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwas-sydney-powell-in-a-sorority-at-the-university-of-mount-union.html&title=Was%20Sydney%20Powell%20in%20a%20sorority%20at%20the%20University%20of%20Mount%20Union%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwas-sydney-powell-in-a-sorority-at-the-university-of-mount-union.html&title=Was%20Sydney%20Powell%20in%20a%20sorority%20at%20the%20University%20of%20Mount%20Union%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwas-sydney-powell-in-a-sorority-at-the-university-of-mount-union.html&description=Was%20Sydney%20Powell%20in%20a%20sorority%20at%20the%20University%20of%20Mount%20Union%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./where-is-andrea-vazquez-boyfriend-now-kidnapped-and-murder-case-update-693265-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where Is Andrea Vazquez Boyfriend Now?
