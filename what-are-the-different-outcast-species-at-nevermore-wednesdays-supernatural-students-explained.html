The show, created by Miles Millar and Alfred Gough is led by Scream (2022) star, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenna Ortega</a> as the titular Wednesday Addams. Viewers get to watch as Wednesday navigates her supernatural abilities after transferring to Nevermore Academy.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>Viewers of the show know that the schoolhouses at Nevermore Academy are made up of supernatural beings who have different abilities. As the show progresses, we get to see Wednesday interact with these different groups, each of whom are considered to be “outcasts” like herself.</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>For those who want a refresher on who these people are and why they’re considered “outcasts” in the first place, here’s a breakdown.</p><h2 id=h-vampires-fangs data-injectable=false><strong>Vampires / Fangs</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Yoko-Tanaka.jpg><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>Fans of supernatural drama or thrillers are not unfamiliar with the concept of vampires and their abilities. However, the show, which calls these supernatural beings “fangs” took a different approach in their portrayal of them by not displaying their powers.</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=228 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, viewers barely get to meet any fangs other than Yoko Tanaka (Naomi J. Ogawa), who was Enid’s roommate for a short time. For whatever screentime Yoko occupied, she was seen wearing sunglasses in bright daylight.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>This is interesting because, unlike the daylight rings vampires possess in shows like The Vampire Diaries and The Originals that protect them from being burned in sunlight, it appears that Wednesday has replaced rings with sunglasses.</p><p data-characters=137 data-current-count=137 data-injectable=false>With the show’s upcoming second season, hopefully, we’ll get to find out more about why this is and see more fangs in action.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Werewolves</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Enid-Sinclair.jpg><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>The show did not leave out one of the most powerful and popular supernatural species of all time – werewolves. Even though the viewers could not glean much information about them, the show reiterates the story of their transformation during the full moon night (one of the common mythological lore associated with werewolves).</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true>This is evident through the ordeal that Wednesday’s roommate <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Enid Sinclair</a> finds herself in, as she serves as the only detailed depiction of the creature in the series. Enid’s difficulty with “wolfing out” becomes the show’s vital subplot.</p><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>While we didn’t get too much werewolf screentime, we get to see Enid’s nails turning into sharp claws whenever she gets excited or afraid. It is not until the very last episode that the viewers finally get to see Enid’s complete transformation and her subsequent fight with Hyde in that very form.</p><p data-characters=131 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>We’re hopeful that the next season will give us more Enid screentime so that we can learn more about the life of a werewolf.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Sirens</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Bianca-Barclay-1.jpg><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>Among the pupils of Nevermore, the sirens are an interesting outcast species of which Bianca is the queen bee. The former nemesis of Wednesday turned into her accomplice in defeating Hyde. She possesses the power of persuasion, which is the ability of a siren.</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>Sirens are mermaid-like creatures who use their songs to influence others’ thoughts, decisions, and actions. This manipulative ability is the cause of Bianca’s breakup with her boyfriend Xavier. The sirens also possess the power to turn into mermaids underwater. Their legs and hands turn into mermaid tails and razor-sharp claws, respectively.</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true>Even though we did not get to see Bianca in that form, a glimpse of the siren’s powers could be caught at the Canoe Race, where a siren turned into a mermaid and attempted to sabotage Wednesday’s approaching victory at the race.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Gorgons</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-20.png><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=631 data-injectable=true>There’s a very good reason why gorgons are required to cover their heads at all times, even when they’re using the mirror. They have snakes on top of their heads, a glimpse of which can turn anyone to stone. The show clearly took inspiration from Greek mythology while representing the Medusa-like characters, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gorgons</a>.</p><p data-characters=100 data-current-count=100 data-injectable=false>The only Gorgon that we get to see on the show is Enid’s crush and love interest, Ajax Petropolus.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Psychics</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Featured-image-of-Jenna-Ortegas-iconic-dance-in-Wednesday.jpg><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>Nevermore is filled with students with psychic abilities, and Wednesday Addams is one of them. She has the power to use her visions to see past events and predict the future. She is mostly able to experience these visions after touching an object, which triggers her supernatural abilities. This is seen at the very beginning of the show when she touches her brother <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pugsley</a> and it allows her to identify his bullies.</p><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>Besides Wednesday, there are other essential characters whose powers bordered on psychic abilities. This includes Rowan, Hyde’s first victim. He possessed telekinetic powers which he inherited from his mother, allowing him to throw objects and people around as well as the ability to experience visions, like Wednesday. In the series, he seemed to foresee Wednesday destroying the school, which caused him to almost kill her before getting brutally slain by Hyde.</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>Another character explored in the show is Xavier Thorpe, who possesses the power to bring painted objects to life. Despite the show never thoroughly exploring his powers, much emphasis was placed on his ability to predict the future through his dreams.</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=586 data-injectable=true>Not unlike Xavier, Rowan, and Wednesday, Eugene is shown to have a psychic connection with the bees. His capability in manipulating and controlling the movement of the bees was showcased towards the end when he led a swarm of bees to attack Laurel/Marilyn Thornhill. This saved Wednesday and other outcasts from getting killed by her.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Shapeshifters</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Larissa-Weems.jpg><p data-characters=150 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>Nevermore also contains a shapeshifter and it is none other than Principal Larissa Weems (Gwendoline Christie) who was a roommate of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Morticia Addams</a>.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>Her abilities were first revealed to viewers when she transformed into Rowan to hide his death from the public. When Wednesday confronted her about the secret, she justified her act as a necessary step to protect the ‘outcasts’ and the school’s reputation. She also used her powers to assist Wednesday when Marilyn Thornhill’s identity was revealed to the audience.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Hyde</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Tyler.jpg><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>The list won’t be complete without mentioning the series’ primary antagonist, Hyde, who also happens tp be a supernatural creature whose acts of murdering the students at Nevermore constitute the show’s major mystery. It was not until the penultimate episode that viewers were introduced to the identity of Hyde, who was Wednesday’s potential love interest Tyler.</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=688 data-injectable=true>In her extensive search for details about the monster, Wednesday could barely lay hands on any vital information except that they never attended the supernatural-filled Nevermore Academy. As the series progressed, the viewers were introduced to some of the intriguing facts about the creatures uncovered by Wednesday.</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>These include how, unlike other supernatural beings, Hydes cannot turn at his own will but needs to be guided by a mentor for their inner monster to get unleashed. It was later revealed that Tyler’s mother was a Hyde and the trait was passed on to her son.</p><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=388 data-injectable=false>Wednesday is currently streaming on Netflix and a second season, which is sure to explore these characters further, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">is on the way</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZJqqlWLBqbGMnaCfnpWnsq%2FAjKisrZuRqMFuv8%2BemqKdo2KutXnNnq2eqp2kv6Z51p6bp52jma66v4ysrKmdoqOutcHRmqNmq6Sqsaa606xknrCgoa6qusSdZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-are-the-different-outcast-species-at-nevermore-wednesdays-supernatural-students-explained.html&text=What%20are%20the%20different%20outcast%20species%20at%20Nevermore%3f%20Wednesdays%20supernatural%20students%20explaine&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-are-the-different-outcast-species-at-nevermore-wednesdays-supernatural-students-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-are-the-different-outcast-species-at-nevermore-wednesdays-supernatural-students-explained.html&title=What%20are%20the%20different%20outcast%20species%20at%20Nevermore%3f%20Wednesdays%20supernatural%20students%20explaine" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-are-the-different-outcast-species-at-nevermore-wednesdays-supernatural-students-explained.html&title=What%20are%20the%20different%20outcast%20species%20at%20Nevermore%3f%20Wednesdays%20supernatural%20students%20explaine" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-are-the-different-outcast-species-at-nevermore-wednesdays-supernatural-students-explained.html&title=What%20are%20the%20different%20outcast%20species%20at%20Nevermore%3f%20Wednesdays%20supernatural%20students%20explaine" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-are-the-different-outcast-species-at-nevermore-wednesdays-supernatural-students-explained.html&description=What%20are%20the%20different%20outcast%20species%20at%20Nevermore%3f%20Wednesdays%20supernatural%20students%20explaine" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./brooklynn-white.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brooklynn White- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Ethnicity">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./telemarketers-tv-review-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Telemarketers movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2023)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
