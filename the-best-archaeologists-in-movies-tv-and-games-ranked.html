And yet while there are only five official Indy movies, the cinematic might of Dr. Henry Jones Jr. has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cast a long shadow across not just movies, but all forms of media</a>. In short,<strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones</a> </strong>made archaeology a cool job for a hero to have.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>There are various tomb-raiding characters in films, TV, and games who very much follow in Indy’s footsteps, being larger-than-life swashbuckling sorts who go on globe-trotting adventures. Other fictional archaeologists may be slightly closer to fact or else their profession is just one element of their persona – so much so that you might just forget what they do for a day-job in the first place.</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>Regardless of what kind of archaeologist they are, all are welcome in this run-down of the finest treasure-seeking, bone-dusting history buffs from across pop culture, be they from sci-fi, supernatural, or superhero-themed media. Let’s get excavating…</p><h2 id=h-10-elizabeth-shaw data-injectable=false>10. Elizabeth Shaw</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=630 data-current-count=630 data-injectable=true>It’s an impossible task to take over as the new protagonist of the Alien franchise after Sigourney Weaver’s inimitable Ellen Ripley, but while Prometheus didn’t exactly hit the same spot as earlier entries in the series, fans have always taken warmly to Noomi Rapace’s Elizabeth Shaw – who is much more of an intellectual heroine than an action one like Ripley. Although, having said that, we do essentially have her to thank for the existence of Xenomorphs in the first place. Even though Dr. Shaw doesn’t really get the whole “don’t recklessly touch stuff” part of archaeology.</p><h2 id=h-9-hawkman-and-hawkgirl data-injectable=false>9. Hawkman and Hawkgirl</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=509 data-current-count=809 data-injectable=true>While Aldis Hodge’s version was depicted as more of a Bruce Wayne-type than his comic book counterpart, the Smallville take on the character did a better job showcasing his archaeological roots as one season 10 episode saw Lois Lane joining Carter Hall for an expedition in Egypt. While Hawkman is more generally associated with being an archaeologist in DC lore, his eternally reincarnated love interest Hawkgirl occasionally follows him into the profession too, notably in the DC Bombshells universe.</p><h2 id=h-8-doctor-fate data-injectable=false>8. Doctor Fate</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=513 data-current-count=813 data-injectable=true>What is it with DC superheroes having archaeology day jobs? On top of the Hawks, Dan Garrett’s Blue Beetle and (sorry to remind you of Suicide Squad) Enchantress, we have Doctor Fate. Much like his Justice Society teammate Carter Hall, Kent Nelson’s status as an archaeologist was mostly glossed over in Black Adam. Nonetheless, Pierce Brosnan did a terrific job as a venerable hero cursed with the power of prophecy, serving as one of the few highlights of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dwayne Johnson’s dud of a DC debut</a>.</p><h2 id=h-7-doctor-aphra data-injectable=false>7. Doctor Aphra</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=563 data-current-count=863 data-injectable=true>Doctor Aphra makes her debut appearance in the&nbsp;Darth Vader&nbsp;comic series. A morally dubious archaeologist, mechanic, and lover of murderous droids, Aphra has a knack for getting into trouble. The weapons collector firmly believes that fear of the unknown — aka literal murder machines — is a waste of time and that those oh-so-dangerous pieces of history should be shared and studied. &nbsp;More than capable of discovering Luke Skywalker’s true identity and outplaying Darth Vader himself, Aphra is a mighty contender for the best archaeologist in the galaxy.</p><h2 id=h-6-river-song data-injectable=false>6. River Song</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=706 data-current-count=1006 data-injectable=true>“I’m a time traveler, I point and laugh at archaeologists.” So says David Tennant’s Doctor upon meeting Alex Kingston’s Professor River Song, and yet from this arrogant introduction sprung the most epic and timey-wimey love story in Doctor Who history. Playing out across the Matt Smith and Peter Capaldi era, the complex and tragic romance between the Doctor and River is the stuff of Whoniverse legend, but let’s not overlook River’s importance as her own character. Equally as adept at excavating a tomb of Weeping Angels, toting a gun while facing an alien invasion, or dressing to the nines, River is an archaeologist who points and laughs at time travelers.</p><h2 id=h-5-benjamin-gates data-injectable=false>5. Benjamin Gates</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true>Once again, not technically an archaeologist, Benjamin Gates is one of the more archaeologist-adjacent entries on this list. A treasure hunter and cryptologist, Gates enjoyed a successful career long before he made the bold decision to steal the Declaration of Independence.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=507 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true>Nic Cage is famous for many things, but among America’s youth his greatest accomplishment is inarguably contained within National Treasure’s heavily-memed Declaration of Independence storyline, and there’s no denying how impressive his work in the 2004 film is. He might come off as a bit more conman than scientist — after all, that’s quite the heist — but through all the misappropriation of treasured American artifacts, he’s still focused on that ever-necessary goal of preserving history.</p><h2 id=h-4-rick-o-connell-and-evie-carnahan data-injectable=false>4. Rick O’Connell and Evie Carnahan</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=755 data-injectable=true>Sometimes two archaeologists are better than one. Like several of the other entries on this list, neither Rick O’Connel nor Evie Carnahan are technically archaeologists by trade, but their combined skills make for a team of truly epic proportions. Evie’s got the information area covered — thanks to a background in egyptology and a lifelong dream of finding the Book of Amun-Ra — and O’Connell lays out enemies like Indiana Jones on steroids.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>Individually, both Evie and O’Connell likely would have ended up dead or lost in a pitch-dark ancient tomb, but as a team, they are a powerhouse unlike any other. Flawlessly trading quips, and with a female lead that doesn’t sacrifice strength for her femininity, the O’Connell/Carnahan team-up is one for the ages — even if they didn’t manage to “discover” so much as “destroy.”</p><h2 id=h-3-nathan-drake data-injectable=false>3. Nathan Drake</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=697 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=641 data-current-count=641 data-injectable=true>He’s not technically an archaeologist, but Uncharted’s Nathan Drake ticks all the right boxes to deserve a spot on this list. Untrained in the specifics of archaeology, like carbon dating and the humdrum process of properly excavating artifacts, Drake still manages to locate and recover some truly impressive antiquities. Known for his witty comebacks, supreme luck in the face of impossible odds, and knack for tracking down elusive finds, Drake may call himself a “treasure hunter,” but he’s up there with the greats of archaeology. Now if he could just sort out how to keep from causing so much mayhem everywhere he goes.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-2-lara-croft data-injectable=false>2. Lara Croft</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=677 data-injectable=true>More than a decade after Indiana Jones made archaeology look much cooler than Howard Carter ever could, Lara Croft proved that it could also be alluring. Sauntering onto the scene in 1996 with the first-ever Tomb Raider game, Lara’s design has changed significantly over the years, but we’ll always remember those massive, pointy boobs that helped popularize the character.</p><p data-characters=614 data-current-count=614 data-injectable=true>These days, Lara is treated much more as an actual contender for the title of “best fictional archaeologist,” thanks to numerous modernized reboots. No, we’re not talking about Angelina Jolie’s sensual take on the character (though she did channel the sex appeal of the early games), but rather the clever and capable Lara that debuted in titles like 2013’s Tomb Raider, and even 2006’s Tomb Raider: Legend. This is the take on female archaeology we’ve always wanted from the franchise — adventurous, courageous, and more focused on solving puzzles and uncovering artifacts than&nbsp;with showing skin.</p><h2 id=h-1-indiana-jones data-injectable=false>1. Indiana Jones</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=806 data-current-count=1106 data-injectable=false>The man, the myth, the legend himself. Indiana Jones made being a swashbuckling archaeologist cool, and all these other copycats are just Dr. Jones wannabes. Don’t get me wrong, we love the likes of O’Connell and Croft in this newsroom, but they’ll never quite match up to what makes Indy, Indy. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">He’s played to flawless perfection by Harrison Ford</a>, and — over more than 40 years — he’s only suffered a few missteps. Indiana is clever, well-read, and utterly fascinated by the work he does. Sure, he’s punched more Nazis than Captain America, but Jones is an academic at heart. He’s enthralled by the items he hunts, trinkets and testimonies to lost worlds and long-abandoned civilizations, and it’s his heart, passion, and schoolboy eagerness that really makes him the best of the best.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXZeytMCMmqmcoJGavK27xqKqratdnrtuuc6voJ6rXanDbq3NnWSgmZ2awG6%2BwKeinpxf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-best-archaeologists-in-movies-tv-and-games-ranked.html&text=The%2010%20best%20archaeologists%20in%20movies%2c%20TV%2c%20and%20games%2c%20ranked&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-best-archaeologists-in-movies-tv-and-games-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-best-archaeologists-in-movies-tv-and-games-ranked.html&title=The%2010%20best%20archaeologists%20in%20movies%2c%20TV%2c%20and%20games%2c%20ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-best-archaeologists-in-movies-tv-and-games-ranked.html&title=The%2010%20best%20archaeologists%20in%20movies%2c%20TV%2c%20and%20games%2c%20ranked" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-best-archaeologists-in-movies-tv-and-games-ranked.html&title=The%2010%20best%20archaeologists%20in%20movies%2c%20TV%2c%20and%20games%2c%20ranked" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-best-archaeologists-in-movies-tv-and-games-ranked.html&description=The%2010%20best%20archaeologists%20in%20movies%2c%20TV%2c%20and%20games%2c%20ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./aew-bunny-concussion-fractured-orbital-bone-dynamite.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="AEW's Bunny May Have Fractured Orbital Bone After Dynamite Match Ended Early">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./emmanuel-ochoa-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-and-life-story.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emmanuel Ochoas biography, net worth, fact, career, awards and life story">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
